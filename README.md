## Reason of Existence...
This repository is just an online safeplace for a very basic script that starts/opens a specific link to a page the 'user' can define. (Will be mostly be a Forms page) --> (I cannot legally place these links here, so hence why it is just a placebo script.)

We use this within our organisation so our first-line IT colleagues can use this to add this simple line of code as an .exe/.bat to the SEB configs.

### Multiple versions?
It could be that there will be a menu in the future since this is the 'placeholder' script that our first line IT colleagues will use. But they to configure multiple versions since there are multiple locations and rooms that need to be addressed. 

I will come back to this question. ^
