## 06-04-2023 - @REALSDEALS
Changed the script to not open up the default browser but instead it opens up Firefox.

Repository has been created and the main info has been added to the repository. 

The main script already excists within the repository, it's nothing special but our colleagues from every section (besides IT) should be able to configure this to their likings. 

Added a UAC policy to the script, but I'm not sure if we should use it yet in combination with SEB. Hence why I added it just to be sure.

Pause function is also a point of discussion, could be that it would be deleted in a rework. It could also be that we would make the script more universal, or an extra version with a menu etc for our IT colleagues, since we have more than 1 location and multiple rooms across those locations.
